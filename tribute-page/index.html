    <h3 id="headline"> Here's a timeline of the life of Warren Buffett:</h3>
    <li><strong>1930</strong> - On August 30, Warren Edward Buffett is born to his parents, Howard and Leila Buffett, in Nebraska. </li>
  <li><strong>1941</strong> - At 11 years old, Warren buys his first stock. He purchases six shares of Cities Service preferred stock (three shares for himself, three for his sister, Doris), at a cost of $38 per share. The company falls to $27 but shortly climbs back to $40. Warren and Doris sell their stock. Almost immediately, it shoots up to over $200 per share. </li>
    <li><strong>1943</strong> - Warren declares to a friend of the family that he will be a millionaire by the time he turns thirty, or "(I'll) jump off the tallest building in Omaha." </li>
  <li><strong>1945</strong> - Warren is making $175 monthly delivering Washington Post newspapers. At fourteen years old, he invests $1,200 of his savings into 40 acres of farmland.</li>
  <li><strong>1947</strong> - In his senior year of high school, Warren and a friend purchase a used pinball machine at a cost of $25. Buffett begins to think about the potential profit and places it in a nearby Barber Shop. Within months, he owns three machines in three different locations. The business is sold later in the year for $1,200 to a war veteran.
  In the same year, Warren has earned over $5,000 delivering newspapers. His father presses him to attend college, a suggestion Warren does not take well. Nevertheless, that year, he enrolls as a freshman at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce in Pennsylvania. Buffett hates it, complaining he knows more than the teachers.</li>
  <li><strong>1949</strong> - Classmates return to find that Warren is no longer enrolled at Wharton. He has transferred to the University of Nebraska. He is offered a job at J.C. Penny's after college but turns it down. He graduates from college in only three years by taking his last three credits over the summer. His savings have reached $9,800.</li>
  <li><strong>1950</strong> - Buffett applies for admission to Harvard Business School and is turned down. He eventually enrolls at Columbia after learning that Ben Graham and David Dodd, two well-known security analysts, are professors.</li>
  <li><strong>1951</strong> - Warren discovers Graham is on the board of GEICO insurance. He takes a train to Washington, D.C., and knocks on the door of its headquarters until a janitor lets him in. After asking if anyone is working, he finds a man on the sixth floor, who ends up being high up in the company. They talk for hours while Warren questions him on the business and insurance in general. Buffett now owns GEICO entirely. Buffett graduates and wants to go to work on Wall Street in the same year. Both his father (Howard) and mentor (Graham) urge him not to. Warren offers to work for Ben Graham for free but Graham refuses.
  He purchases a Texaco station as a side investment, but it doesn't work out as well as he hopes. Meanwhile, he is working as a stockbroker.
  Buffett takes a Dale Carnegie public speaking course. Using what he learned, he began to teach a night class at the University of Nebraska, "Investment Principles". The students were twice his age, as he was only 21 at the time.
  
  Warren returns home and begins dating Susan Thompson. In April, Warren and Susie get married. They rent an apartment for $65 a month and have their first child, also named Susie</li>
  <li><strong>1954</strong> - Ben Graham calls Warren and offers him a job at his partnership. Buffett's starting salary is $12,000 a year.</li>
  <li><strong>1956</strong> - Graham retires and folds up his partnership. Since leaving college six years earlier, Warren's personal savings have grown from $9,800 to over $140,000. The same year, the Buffett family returns home to Omaha. On May 1, Warren creates Buffett Associates, Ltd. Seven family members and friends put in a total of $105,000. Buffett himself invests only $100. He's now running his own partnership, and will never again work for anyone else. Over the course of the year, he opens two additional partnerships, eventually bringing the number under his management to three. Years later, they will all be consolidated into one.</li>
  <li><strong>1957</strong> - Buffett adds two more partnerships to his collection. He is now managing five investment partnerships from his home.

  <li><strong>1960</strong> - Warren asks one of his partners, a doctor, to find 10 other doctors who will be willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership. Eventually, 11 doctors agreed to invest.</li>
  <li><strong>1961</strong> - With the partnerships now worth millions, Buffett made his first one million dollar investment in a windmill manufacturing company.</li>
  <li><strong>1962</strong> - Buffett returns to New York with Susie for a few weeks to raise capital from his old acquaintances. During the trip, he picks up a few partners and several hundred thousand dollars. The Buffett Partnership, which had begun with $105,000, was now worth $7.2 million. Warren and Susie personally own over one million of the assets. Buffett merges all of the partnerships into one entity known simply as Buffett Partnerships, Ltd. The operations are moved to Kiewit Plaza, a functional but less-than-grand office, where they remain to this day. The minimum investment is raised from $25,000 to $100,000.
  In the same year, Buffett consults Munger on Dempster, the windmill manufacturing company. Munger recommends Harry Bottle to Warren, a move that would turn out to be very profitable. Bottle cut costs, laid-off workers, and caused the company to generate cash.
